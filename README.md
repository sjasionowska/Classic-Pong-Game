# Classic-Pong-Game

Classic Pong game made with JS and HTML5 canvas. First commit was made with Chris DeLeon's tutorial available for free here: https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/learn/v4/content with some small changes. CSS style was mine. As a player, you can move the left paddle using mouse. Right paddle is controlled by a computer with very simple AI system. Game checks how many points do you have and ends if someone gets more than 5.
